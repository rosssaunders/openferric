//! Module `engines::numerical::mod`.
//!
//! Implements mod abstractions and re-exports used by adjacent pricing/model modules.
//!
//! References: Hull (11th ed.) Ch. 13, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (1979), and backward-induction recursions around Eq. (13.10).
//!
//! Primary API surface: module-level exports and submodule wiring.
//!
//! Numerical considerations: convergence is first- to second-order in time-step count depending on tree parameterization; deep ITM/OTM nodes may need larger depth.
//!
//! When to use: use trees for early-exercise intuition and lattice diagnostics; use analytic formulas for plain vanillas and Monte Carlo/PDE for richer dynamics.
