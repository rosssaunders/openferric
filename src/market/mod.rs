//! Module `market::mod`.
//!
//! Implements mod abstractions and re-exports used by adjacent pricing/model modules.
//!
//! References: Hull (11th ed.) for market conventions and payoff identities, with module-specific equations referenced by the concrete engines and models imported here.
//!
//! Primary API surface: module-level exports and submodule wiring.
//!
//! Numerical considerations: validate edge-domain inputs, preserve finite values where possible, and cross-check with reference implementations for production use.
//!
//! When to use: choose this module when its API directly matches your instrument/model assumptions; otherwise use a more specialized engine module.
